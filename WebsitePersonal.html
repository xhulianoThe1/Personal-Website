  <p>Hey! My name is Xhuliano Brace and this is my painfully plain website. </p>
  <p>I currently attend the University at Albany where I am working towards Bachelor of Science degrees in Applied Mathematics/Computer Science as well as Economics.</p>
  <p> I usually spend my time working on my financial models, machine learning projects, or perfecting my trading algorithms.</p>     
  <p> I also create more aesthetically pleasing websites than this one --> here. </p> 
  <p> These are the links to my various accounts which might be of some intrigue; </p>
